# 🎲 Dicer

A **roguelike dice-building game** inspired by *Balatro*, where the "deck" is nowhere in sight — and every roll could be your last. Embrace your inner gambler and challenge **Lady Luck** herself using special dice known as **Fate Dice**.

Built in **Godot 4.4**, *Dicer* combines chance, strategy, and chaos into a fast-paced and endlessly replayable experience. Will you conquer fate or fall victim to it?

## ✨ What Are Fate Dice?

**Fate Dice** are no ordinary dice. Each comes imbued with unique, randomized effects that can turn the tide of any game. Some examples:

- 🔁 Reroll other dice  
- ✖️ Multiply your score  
- ⬇️ Lower your opponent's score  
- 📈 Grow in value every round  

These effects stack, combine, and interact in unexpected ways — making every game a new puzzle.

## 🎮 How to Play

1. 🎲 You begin each run with **4 regular dice** and **1 random Fate Die**.

3. ⚖️ Win conditions vary per match:
   - Highest total score
   - Most odd/even numbers
   - Highest score using the **fewest dice**
   - ...and more to come!

4. 🌀 The game is **endless**, but future updates may introduce:
   - 👥 **Multiplayer mode**
